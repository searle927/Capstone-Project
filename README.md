## Project Description
I recently got engaged and found out I'd need a wedding website, so I figured why not make one for my capstone project. The website will entail 6 pages (Welcome page, Details page, Destination page, Advice page, Registry page and RSVP page). The advice page will be full CRUD allowing people to create, edit and delete their advice to the bride and groom. Other people will also be able to make comments on the advice as well (almost turning that page into a blog or chat room).

## Wireframes
Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app

## USER STORIES
End users and Admin will be given the opprtunity to communicate throughout the Advice page. You can post whatever advice you have for the bride and groom about married life and planning a wedding. Other people will also be able to comment on the post as an add on. I'm thinking about giving strong params to the Admin when it comes to deleting messages, but I'm not sure yet.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App |   | 
| NavBar |   | 
| MainPage |    | 
| Details |    | 
| Destination |    | 
| Advice |   | 
| Registry |   | 
| RSVP |   | 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
