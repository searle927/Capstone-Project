Project Description
I recently got engaged and found out I'd need a wedding website, so I figured why not make one for my capstone project. The website will entail 6 pages (Welcome page, Details page, Destination page, Advice page, Registry page and RSVP page). The advice page will be full CRUD allowing people to create, edit and delete their advice to the bride and groom. Other people will also be able to make comments on the advice as well (almost turning that page into a blog).

USER STORIES
End users and Admin will be given the opprtunity to communicate throughout the Advice page. You can post whatever advice you have for the bride and groom about married life and planning a wedding. Other people will also be able to comment on the post as an add on. I'm thinking about giving strong params to the Admin when it comes to deleting messages, but I'm not sure yet.
